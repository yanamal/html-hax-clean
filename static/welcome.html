    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <div>HTML Hax is a website which teaches you HTML through a series of "hacking" style puzzles.</div>
    <div>Each puzzle is a web page. To solve it, you must:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Read the source HTML <span>(and sometimes other code)</span></li>
      <li>Find the password <span>(or find another way to get through the puzzle)</span></li>
      <li>Submit the password using the form <span>(or sometimes through other hacks!)</span></li>
    </ol>
    <div>Not sure how you'd do any of those things? don't worry, the first puzzle shows you!</div>
